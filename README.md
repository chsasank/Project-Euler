Project-Euler
=============

Some of my python codes used for solving Project Euler problems - https://projecteuler.net/problems
So far solved 34 problems. Will keep updating as I solve more.

Nummath.py is my custom library to do some number theory like Eratosthenes sieve, finding nth prime and much more.
Will keep updating it as I need more and more number theory.
